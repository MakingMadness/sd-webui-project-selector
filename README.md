# Project Selector

An extension for Automatic1111's Stable Diffusion WebUI.

After selecting a project, your output destinations will be changed until you select another, or deselect it. You could have a folder for experiments, different clients, personal projects, and each one would have their own output folder structure so you can keep things organised.
